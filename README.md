What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Develop code using algorithms and data structures to solve basic programming problems

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem first with pseudocode and then I used similar data structures to what was used in the assignments.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I was stopped by the roadblocks and the code from project two does not compile.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
If I program these things again in the future, I will do better

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I got much needed practice with pseudocode and saw how to make a well-documented and well-modularized program.
